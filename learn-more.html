    <h2>What “Personal” Means</h2>
    <p>
      AuroKey gets better over time because it remembers.
      It builds a living understanding of how you like to travel—pace, comfort, food, neighborhoods,
      airlines, budget, “musts,” and “never-agains.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So you don’t have to start from scratch every trip.

    <h2>What “Intelligence” Means</h2>
    <p>
      AuroKey doesn’t just show you options. It helps you decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It produces a small number of strong choices and makes the tradeoffs clear—
      so you can move forward confidently.

      <li>AuroKey returns a few options that fit you.</li>
      <li>Each option includes what you’re choosing and what you’re giving up.</li>
      <li>You choose. AuroKey learns. The next trip gets easier.</li>
