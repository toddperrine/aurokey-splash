  <!-- THE IDEA -->
  <section id="idea">
    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Great travel isn’t about having more options. It’s about making better choices—quickly and confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      AuroKey removes the work between the idea of a trip and the moment you’re ready to go.
      You describe what you want. AuroKey handles the tradeoffs. You move forward.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT AUROKEY DOES -->
  <section id="what">
    <h2>What AuroKey Does</h2>
    <p>
      AuroKey is <strong>Personal Travel Intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It builds a living understanding of how you like to travel—your pace, preferences, priorities,
      and constraints—and uses that understanding to shape every recommendation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less research</li>
      <li>Less planning</li>
      <li>Fewer decisions to make</li>
      <li>Better outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Which means you stop postponing trips—and start taking them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section id="how">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      You tell AuroKey what you want in plain language.
    </p>
    <p>
      AuroKey responds with a small number of strong options—each one explained:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why it fits you</li>
      <li>What you’re choosing</li>
      <li>What you’re giving up</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You choose. The system remembers. Each trip makes the next one easier—and better.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TRAVEL MORE -->
  <section id="travel-more">
    <h2>Why People Travel More With AuroKey</h2>
    <p>
      Because the friction disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      You no longer need hours of research, endless comparisons, spreadsheets, or group threads.
      When the mental load is gone, travel becomes something you do more often—not something you keep putting off.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY DIFFERENT -->
  <section id="why-different">
    <h2>Why This Feels Different</h2>
    <p>
      AuroKey doesn’t start from scratch every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remembers what you value, learns from your choices, and adapts as your life changes.
      Over time, planning a great trip feels almost effortless.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the difference between using tools—and having intelligence working for you.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      If you care about quality, confidence, and making the most of your time,
      AuroKey quickly becomes something you don’t want to travel without.
